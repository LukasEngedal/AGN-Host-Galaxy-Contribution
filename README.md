# Investigating the Host Galaxy Contribution in Spectra of Active Galactic Nuclei with Simulations
This repository is for the rapport as well as the full implementation created in connection with the bachelor thesis done at the University of Copenhagen in 2013 by me, Lukas Engedal. This is from back when I was a physics student at the university.

The thesis is available in thesis.pdf.

The code is found in the "src" folder, and is just one big mess of .pro files written in a obscure language called IDL, used mainly by astrophysicists. The code was not initially made public when I handed in the thesis, and so I never bothered to clean it up.

The code relied on a complex program for actually analyzing the AGN spectra, referred to as 'mpfitfun' and written by my supervisor and her group, that I no longer have access to, which means that it is not really possible to do anything too meaningful with the code anymore. Nonetheless, there are various main files created for doing different tasks, with for instance the "main_iter" file being a good example of what I was doing at the time.
